    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) goat cheese log</li>
        <li>2 cups marinara sauce</li>

       <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
       <li>Press goat cheese to fit the shape of a small baking dish, 
        leaving a 1-inch border around the edge. Gently spoon marinara sauce around the border,

            and bubbling,20 to 25 minutes.</li>
