        <p>These crustless grilled cheese sandwiches are great to have
             stashed in the freezer for when the kids need a quick snack.</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>8 slices white sandwich bread</li>
            <li>4 slices Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons softened butter, or as needed</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Spread a thin layer of butter onto 1 side of each slice of bread</li>
            <li>Using a round cookie cutter that is slightly smaller than the sandwich sealer,
                press out round slices of cheese.
                 Lay 4 slices of bread on a work surface,
                buttered side down. Place a cheese round in the center of each slice.
                Top with remaining 4 bread slices, buttered side up.</li>
            <li>Center a sandwich sealer over a sandwich, press the sealer down,
                 and hold it in place to seal the edges, 15 to 30 seconds. 
                 Pull the crusts away from the sealer; discard.
                 Repeat with remaining sandwiches.</li>
            <li>place sandwich discs on a parchment-lined baking sheet and
                 freeze for 2 hours before transferring into a freezer bag.</li>
            <li>Preheat the air fryer to 380 degrees F (193 degrees C). 
                Cook frozen sandwiches until golden,
                 about 5 minutes. If sandwiches are thawed, 
                 cook 3 minutes at 370 degrees F (188 degrees C).</li>
        </ol>
